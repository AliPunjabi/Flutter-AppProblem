# Flutter-AppProblem
Hey so as you can see the title always changes but at the appBar but I don't want that the title changes on the Appbar I want that the title changes in the SizedBox but there is always just written "Smoothie-Bowl"  In the picture "whatImean" the text above the blue line shouldn't change and the text above the red line should change
